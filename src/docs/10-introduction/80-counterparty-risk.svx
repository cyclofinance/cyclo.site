## Counterparty Risk
Unlike traditional DeFi lending protocols, Cyclo has no counterparty risk because there are no counterparties. When you use Cyclo, you are:
- Not entering into an agreement with another party
- Not borrowing from or lending to anyone
- Not relying on any third party to maintain your position

The protocol is simply a mechanism for splitting your collateral into two complementary parts:
1. cy* tokens representing the USD value
2. Receipt tokens that:
   - Prove ownership of the locked collateral
   - Establish your guaranteed unlock price in cy* tokens

## Protocol Design
The protocol intentionally eliminates common DeFi risks by having:
- No governance or admin controls
- No upgradeable contracts
- No liquidation mechanisms
- No dependency on external price feeds (uses Flare's native FTSO)
- No third-party token dependencies

## Actual Risks

### Smart Contract Risk
- The immutable smart contracts must operate as intended
- The FTSO integration must function correctly
- Any additional integrations (like the sFLR staking contract) must remain valid

### Market Risk
Market risk in Cyclo only exists when trading cy* tokens. Holding both cy* tokens and receipt tokens lets you unlock your original collateral at any time - the protocol guarantees your unlock price through your receipt tokens.

If you sell cy* tokens, you're exposed to their price movements between $0 and $1. To unlock your collateral later, you'll need to repurchase cy* tokens at market price. The protocol never forces trades or liquidations, so you always have the option to wait and recombine your tokens to recover your original position.

### Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulatory frameworks could affect protocol usage, however this is a common risk for all DeFi protocols

## Risk Mitigation
The best protection is understanding that Cyclo is fundamentally an accounting system that:
- Splits your collateral into two parts that can be recombined
- Never puts your original collateral at risk unless you choose to trade
- Keeps your position viable regardless of market conditions
- Has no time limits or forced actions
