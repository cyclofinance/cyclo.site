## Architectural advantages

Notably Cyclo avoids or mitigates the following problems found in various stablecoins, etc.:

- **Liquidation**: Cyclo will never liquidate user's FLR assets for any reason
- **Centralisation**: There are no admin keys or risk parameters to be tuned, not even a DAO
- **Under Collateralization**: There is a strict overcollateralization of all sFLR collateral and circulating cysFLR
- **Tax complexity**: Minting cysFLR is technically akin to wrapping FLR to sFLR, not trading
- **Gas costs**: Minting/burning cysFLR is cheaper than an AMM trade
- **USD regulations**: cysFLR references the FTSO oracle price of FLR not the US dollar, there is no "issuer"
- **Supply constraints**: cysFLR has an unbounded elastic supply
- **Not time based**: Unlike an option, cysFLR never expires and can be held as normal tokens indefinitely
- **Non-custodial**: Like wrapping wETH, all cysFLR is simply a deposit/withdraw to the smart contract
- **Simplicity**: The entire contract is about 100 lines of code beyond Open Zeppelin standard contracts
- **Leverage**: The protocol allows users who increase cysFLR supply to leverage FLR
- **Collateral risk**: Only sFLR is allowed as collateral
- **Front-running/MEV**: No trading or other intrablock hysteresis involved in locking/unlocking
- **Opportunity cost**: An cysFLR mint is fully reversible at any time, unlike selling stables at a local bottom
- **No counterparty**: The smart contracts facilitate internal accounting for each user's own assets for themselves
- **No KYC**: Users mint/burn tokens for themselves directly on-chain
- **No fees**: There are no fees for mint or burn
- **No rebase**: The supply is elastic based on supply/demand rather than algorithmic price targets
- **Licensing**: Cyclo code is released as public domain using the unlicense
- **No upgrades**: cysFLR can only be migrated to a hypothetical new contract by each user
