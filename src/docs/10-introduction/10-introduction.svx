Cyclo rethinks leverage from first principles.

Instead of following the traditional DeFi pattern of lending pools, interest rates, and liquidations, Cyclo creates a simple primitive: the ability to lock collateral (like sFLR or WETH) and mint cy* tokens (like cysFLR or cyWETH) that can trade between $0 and $1.

This design leads to a natural market for leverage. When demand for leverage is high, users lock their collateral and sell cy\* tokens, increasing supply and lowering its price. When traders want to unwind positions, they buy back cy* tokens to unlock their collateral, creating demand that drives the price up.

This cycle repeats naturally without any governance decisions, interest rates, or forced liquidations.

The protocol consists of just three actions:
1. **Lock Collateral to Mint**: Participants lock their tokens (sFLR or WETH) and are issued cy* tokens based on the USD price at the time of transaction, along with an equal number of ERC-1155 receipt tokens with an ID representing the lock-up price.
3. **Trade cy* Tokens**: Users can trade their cy* tokens within the Flare ecosystem.
4. **Burn to Unlock**: To unlock their original collateral, users burn their receipt tokens and an equal amount of the corresponding cy* tokens.

This system provides two main utilities:
1. **Leverage**: A novel mechanism for what is effectively non-liquidating leverage while maintaining the benefits of the underlying collateral (like staking rewards for sFLR).
2. **New cy* Tokens:** Price-bound tokens that can be speculated on or held as alternatives to stablecoins.
