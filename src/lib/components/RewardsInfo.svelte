			<ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-4">
				<li>The average of your eligible balance across two random monthly snapshots</li>
				<li>Your share of all participants' average holdings at those snapshots</li>
				<li>Final rewards may be higher or lower than shown here</li>
				<li>
					The displayed APY is based on current participation and will decrease as more holders join

				Rewards are earned by acquiring cysFLR through approved sources (Raindex, SparkDEX, or
				BlazeSwap) and holding it.
